# Email-Notification-Service

## Database Configuration

This project is using knex to connect to the database where user email addresses are stored. Knex makes it possible to use a database you like unless it is supported.
Supported databases are:

| Database                   | Driver  |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| PostgreSQL/Amazon Redshift | pg      |
| MySQL/MariaDB              | mysql   |
| SQLite3                    | sqlite3 |
| MSSQL                      | mssql   |

To install the driver for your database type in following command:

```
npm install <Driver> --save
```

## Architecture

As shown in the architecture section below, a script shall filter every transaction. The script filter transactions after notifications and saves them locally named with a timestamp as json files in the notification folder.
An external process watches the notification folder and sends the user's ids via http request to the email service using the `sendNotification` endpoint.
The email service checks if the connected database includes an email address for the passed user id. If an email address is found a notification is sent to the configured SMTP host.
Subscribing/unsubscribing to the email notification service can be handled by the user profile of the Trubudget frontend or by using the user.insert/user.delete endpoint of the email service.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to use our pre-set `docker-compose` cluster which starts the whole TruBudget application including all email components (that means you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)).
The pre-set cluster contains:

- 1 Master-Node
- 1 Master API connected to Master-Node
- 1 Frontend connected to Master-API
- 1 Email-Service
- 1 Email-Database (Postgres)

When started the Email-Service sends email notifications to the configured SMTP-host. The default configuration is:

- SMTP_HOST: host.docker.internal(localhost)
- SMTP_PORT: 2500

To configure another database type for storing the user email addresses check out the [Database Configuration section](#database-configuration)
To check what is configurable check out the [Environment Variables section](#environment-variables)
